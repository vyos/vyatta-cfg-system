help: Set plaintext password for encryption
# if plaintext is empty, assume this is left-over from blanking the plaintext
# and do nothing. to set password to empty, user needs to set the
# "encrypted-password" to an empty string (which actually allows login without
# password).

      = `/usr/bin/mkpasswd -H md5 '$VAR(@)' | tr -d \\\\n` \

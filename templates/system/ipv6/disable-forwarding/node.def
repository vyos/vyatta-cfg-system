help: Disable IPv6 forwarding on all interfaces

# Disable IPv6 forwarding for all interfaces we currently have,
# and set default such that it will be disabled on any new interfaces
# that come up after this.
#
create:
	sudo sh -c "echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding"
	sudo sh -c "echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/default/forwarding"

# Re-enable IPv6 forwarding globally.  But setting the global
# forwarding parameter under "all" has the side effect of setting the
# per-interface forwarding parameter for all interfaces.  Users may
# disable forwarding per-interface, so we have to restore the state of
# the per-interface parameter here.   A per-interface flag file under
# /var/run/vyatta/ tells us if forwarding is disabled on specific
# interfaces.  Restore default value of the forwarding parameter under
# "default" so that any new interfaces that come up after this will
# have forwarding enabled.

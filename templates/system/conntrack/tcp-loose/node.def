# 
# This parameter directs the netfilter TCP connection tracking modules
# (nf_conntrack, and others) to either allow or disallow the tracking
# of TCP connections which are "previously established".  This
# includes all cases where the three-way connection opening handshake
# was not seen by this machine.  That includes the case the connection
# was opened before this machine booted.  It also includes cases where
# the packets comprising the three-way handshake were routed via some
# other router.
#
# If this parameter is set to "enable", tracking such connections is
# allowed.  If disabled, such tracking is disabled.
# default value - 1
